<h2>Test</h2>
<div class="wrap">
<h3>Visiual representation of splitted words (green underline)</h3>
<p class="test1">Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Lazer tag. Lazer tag! 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County! It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lazers. Plus, they got bumper boats, so...</p>

<h3>Visiual representation of splitted characters (red underline)</h3>
<p class="test2">Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. If I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, 'Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?' Y'see, so, then where's the trust?  </p>

<h3>Hightlight test (animating each word) <a href="" id="highlight" class="activate">Activate Hightlight</a></h3>
<p class="test4">It is not a disaster. It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it. </p>

<h3>Sinuswave test (animating each character) <a href="" id="sinus" class="activate">Activate Sinuswave</a> </h3>
<p class="test3">You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment. If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it. </p>
